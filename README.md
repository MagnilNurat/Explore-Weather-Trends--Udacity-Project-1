# Explore_Weather_Trends--Udacity-Project-1
In this project, I'm exploring global and local weather trends. 
The local weather data is taken for Hyderabad,India. 
The global and local data is extracted from the database using SQL commands. 
The data is stored as csv files after extraction.
Data exploration is done using excel as the dataset is small.
7 year moving averages are calculated and stored in a new column in the dataset.
I used Tableau to exploratory data analysis and visualizations.
A line chart showing the global temperature trend and another line chart showing local temperature trend are created.
A comparison line chart for both is also created.
I also calculated the co-relation between global and local temperature trend in R.
I made a pdf report summarizing the steps i took to reach a conclusion.
